# Component Tokens
# Component Tokens are used to define parts of a UI component (e.g. button, input, etc.). Parts of a component are seperated to allow for more flexibility in theming.
# Parts of a component include: background, border, text, and shadow. These should also have defined states (e.g. hover, focus, active, etc.).
