# MotionWindUI

MotionWindUI library is a collection of React UI components that are designed to be simple, easy to use, and customizable. The library is built with TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and React Aria.

## Inspiration

The library is heavily inspired and designed by [NextUI](https://nextui.org/). NextUI describes itself from it's [introduction](https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction) as

> NextUI is a UI library for React that helps you build beautiful and accessible user interfaces. Created on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html).

> NextUI's primary goal is to streamline the development process, offering a beautiful and adaptable system design for an enhanced user experience.

When I first discovered NextUI, I was amazed by the simplicity and beauty of the components. There were a few things that I wanted to add or change in the components, so I decided to create my own library. It was also a chance for me to learn about design systems, accessibility, color theory, and animations. When I started the project, I wanted to approach things differently. For example, I wanted to use design tokens all over the place to make components more customizable. As I was working on the project, I realized that I was creating a library that was heavily inspired by NextUI. I decided to embrace it and give credit to the original creators. I learned a lot from the source code of NextUI, and I am grateful for the creators for sharing their work. I thought I was going to create a different yet similar library, but the more I looked at NextUI the more I realized that the approaches they were taking made sense and were effective. This has been a learning project for me, and I really don't have any intention to compete with NextUI.

I really just want to express my gratitude to the creators of NextUI for sharing their work. I have learned a lot from them. I have learned a lot about maintaining, testing, documenting, developing and more. I have learned a lot about making a proper library with various tools that they have found and used. I really appreciate their work and I hope that they continue to share their work with the community.

### Further On My Journey

I was using Figma to design everything. I started a very long time ago on creating design tokens for every single thing. From basic colors, to component specific hover states (for example the background color of a button when hovered in a specific color on a specific variant). As I was learning Figma I was getting into some frustrations and roadblocks. Recently I decided to abandon Figma for a bit to see some results. I decided to carry on using design tokens and still keep component specific tokens. The more I learned from NextUI the more I realized that it might be a bit overkill. So I abandoned it. So I continued and still wanted to use my original technologies such as Radix UI. The more I learned from NextUI the more I realized that React Aria brings more benefits to the table. Continuing on with the project, I realized that I was just kind of being a copycat. I decided to embrace it and give credit to the original creators. I learned a lot from the source code of NextUI, and I am grateful for the creators for sharing their work. I thought I was going to create a different yet similar library, but the more I looked at NextUI the more I realized that the approaches they were taking made sense and were effective. This has been a learning project for me, and I really don't have any intention to compete with NextUI. I just wanted to create a library that I can use in my projects and share it with others.
